Picture “The Amazing Race” meets “America’s Got Talent” with a little touch of documentaries “PressPausePlay” and “American Movie” in the incredible test of time where Thao makes his national stance on supporting struggling street musicians by attempting to sell his idea virtually and topple the Reality world.""

Five Japanese “war brides” of American soldiers who live in Kansas, struggle with their cultural identity and the anti-Japanese prejudice that followed World War II. After one of the women commits suicide, her ghostly presence forces the other women to deal with the tensions of being Japanese in post-war America, marrying a ‘foreigner’ and living separated from their culture.

I'm currently looking for a sublet for my 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in Arlington Height. The location is amazing - just a block away from the Mitsuwa, walking distance to grocery store, park and restaurants.

The neighbors are quiet, younger professionals, and the management company is very quick to respond to any maintenance requests. There is a lot of natural light during the day, and the room for rent can comfortably fit a queen bed with room to spare.

The unit is a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom, in-unit washer/dryer.

Some of the apartment's amenities:
Water included.

We're looking for someone that is clean, reliable with financial obligations, and also someone who is easy to get along with as well - female only! No pets please. Move-in date would be March 1st or earlier, and there is an $250 security deposit. The lease goes through September with an option to renew.

Please contact me by replying to this email with a little bit about yourself, and if it sounds like a fit let's set up a meeting!

I'm helping with social media and outreach for the Asian Pacific Islander American (APIA) Spoken Word & Poetry Summit 2015 in Chicago! :) This year our theme is: Now What?

And one of our online initiatives entails featuring different artists each week (or even multiple times a week) to highlight the variety in content, culture, context, etc. that already exists, but also raising the question of what is missing and how we can lift up those stories and ideas. 

If you have any questions or suggestion, would like to be featured, or would like to recommend artists to feature, or if you simply want to learn more and support our summit, please contact me at soultreecambanationofthangs@gmail.com

Peace,

The 442nd was unit of brigade strength that became the most decorated unit for its size and length of the service in the history of the US Armed forces.
The goal is to finish a spec trailer and start an online funding campaign. Once a solid budget is secured then production will start shooting in the SF Bay Area and Northern California locations.
Invite your friends and family members to support this new film project about the heroes who served in the 442nd.
The film follows a documentary film also about the 442nd called Valor With Honor. Valor has been slowly screening at specific locations across the US. www.valorwithhonor.com

A Cantonese film starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung called THAT DEMON WITHIN is being released today (April 18th) at the AMC River East 21. Come support the film with your friends so we can get more Chinese-language films in Chicago! This film will be in Cantonese with Chinese and English subtitles. 

The China Lion Entertainment (http://www.chinalionentertainment.com) releases Chinese-language films across the U.S. and Canada and would love to make Chicago a more regular stop for their films; of course, the only way for that to happen is through the support of local audiences. Let's help make this happen! 

AACN is given 4 free admission tickets. These can be used between Monday and Thursday. Please message me if you're interested in the ticket. Limited to 1 per person.

The film currently has an average rating of 6.7 (out of 10) on 豆瓣电影 (http://movie.douban.com/subject/20515977/), a Chinese movie review site. That means Chinese people who've watched it deemed it better than average!

My name is Jia Min Gao and I am a research assistant working with doctoral student Julia Tran and Professor Nicola Curtin in the Psychology Department at Clark University.

I am reaching out to you today to see if you would like to volunteer to participate in an online survey that examines Asian Americans’ socio-political beliefs and behaviors. If you are interesting in taking the survey, please click on the link below:
https://clarku.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_72qP4T9MsxBOzZP

People who are eligible to participate are Asian Americans who are 18 and older, and who currently live in the United States for at least three years. Asian international students, visitors to the United States, or anyone who are not planning to live in the United States permanently are not eligible.
 
Each participant will be asked to answer some questions about themselves and give their opinions on some socio-political issues. Participation is entirely voluntary and you don’t have to be politically or socially active to participate. You may decline to answer any question that you do not wish to answer, and you are free to discontinue the study at any time without penalty.

Your responses to all questions will be kept fully confidential. 
 
Upon completion of the survey, you will have the option to provide your email address for entry in a raffle for a $25 gift certificate.
If you have any questions regards to the study, please reply to this email jigao@clarku.edu or contact Julia Tran as jutran@clarku.edu.

Lastly, it would be wonderful if you could forward this email to any individuals who might be interested in participating. Doing so is by no means necessary, but it would be enormously appreciated.
Thank you so much for your time!

Address: 111 W Kinzie. This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. 

CTA: Merchandise Mart (Brown, Purple)

Where we will Meet: Whiskey room to the left. 

Dress code: No gym shoes or tees. 

See you there!",True,True,True,True,True
160475740743826_249336205191112,,,Jonathan Benson,"Friday night!!! Sept 20. This Friday night. Join AACN at Untitled, Kinzie and Lasalle. 111 w kinzie, for drinks at 930pm. No cover. No gym shoes, tees.

e were here a few weeks ago and it was fun, so we're coming back. This time, there will be a burlesque show as well! 

Known as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name ""Untitled"") / trendy whiskey, champagne, and full bar lounge, this place is actually decent.

Location: This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.

CTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away

NOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.

The space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.

Note Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line. Ladies, use judgment - usually they dont reject ladies but just no Sneakers, t-shirts, etc

All: The bouncer usually asks are you here for dinner or drinks. Just respond drinks.

Where we will Meet: WHISKEY ROOM TO THE LEFT.  We will meet here first (don't worry, you can drink anything you want - such as Champagne in the other room or a full bar in the main room - we are just meeting here first). Once you enter and go down the stairs, go directly to the left room which is the whiskey room of the restaurant/lounge, a hostess usually asks you if they can help you or are you here for dinner / drinks? Say drinks and just walk towards the side room on the left. 

For late comers, we will probably eventually work our way to the back of the main dance floor (the bar in the back). 

Don't say you're here with AACN as we are not doing a reservation with the place.  They won't understand you.

Look for Asians in the back and ask, ""Are you with AACN? ;)"" AACN will keep an eye out for you as well.

Be on time at 9:30 PM!  it shouldn't be too crowded in the Whiskey room around that time.",True,True,True,True,True

Synopsis:
THE GRANDMASTER is the highly-anticipated new film by acclaimed director Wong Kar Wai. Six years in the planning and three years in the making, THE GRANDMASTER is an epic action feature inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man. The story spans the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of China’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts. Filmed in a range of stunning locations that include the snow-swept landscapes of Northeast China and the subtropical South, THE GRANDMASTER features virtuoso performances by some of the greatest stars of contemporary cinema.

 With THE GRANDMASTER, Wong Kar Wai has made a kung fu film like no other. Years of research before production and a virtual battalion of martial arts trainers on set ensured that THE GRANDMASTER portrays both the Chinese martial arts and the world of the martial artists with unprecedented authenticity, with fight scenes choreographed by renowned action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (THE MATRIX, KILL BILL, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.) The trio of international superstars at the film’s heart – Tony Leung, Ziyi Zhang and Chang Chen – all underwent several years of rigorous and extremely challenging kung fu training for their roles.

Shot by French Director of Photography Philippe Le Sourd and with art direction by Wong’s long-term collaborators William Chang Suk Ping and Alfred Yau Wai Ming, THE GRANDMASTER represents a new chapter in the martial arts genre and in Wong Kar Wai’s own stellar career.",True,True,True,True,True

Yes, this is part II for Untitled and no, we aren't running out of places that can fit our group; however, since we had such a great time last at Untitled, Come drink and network again this weekend.

Known as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name ""Untitled"") / trendy bars and lounge, this place is actually decent.

Location: This place is located right next to the CVS and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at a garage about a block away -  (La Salle and Kinzie / Wells) $8 to $12 the whole night.

CTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away

NOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs.

The space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.

Note Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line.
