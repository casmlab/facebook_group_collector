We are looking for adult volunteers to help register new voters.  It'll be a great way to meet our staff and the kids that we work with, as well as have fun at the event.  If you want more info, please send me a PM.  Thank you!\n\nRandy Kim","message_tags":{"346":[{"id":"10102102825991979","name":"Randy Kim","type":"user","offset":346,"length":9}]}},{"id":"160475740743826_167344820056918","created_time":"2012-08-01T18:31:05+0000","from":{"name":"Ashish Shah","id":"10153182174947106"},"updated_time":"2012-08-07T02:16:03+0000","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/167344820056918"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/167344820056918"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/167344820056918"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianamericanchicagonetwork/"}],"caption":"chicagoindoorracing.com","message":"Would anybody be interested in Go-karting?
