Are you still using the same old profile picture to represent your professional identity on LinkedIn or other professional websites? Was it taken at a friend's wedding ages ago, or perhaps you had to creatively crop people out of the photo? Allow our photographers to capture an image of you at your best for the small price of...whatever you think the photo is worth! The digital image will be retouched, edited, formatted for web (2048 pixels on the longest side) and sent to you for you to keep! If you love the results, you can also discuss other options with the photographers.","link":"https://www.facebook.com/events/384848134920762/","name":"September TAPpy Hour","object_id":"384848134920762"},{"id":"160475740743826_175070432617690","created_time":"2012-09-17T21:14:58+0000","from":{"name":"Sandy Chang","id":"10105495187387240"},"updated_time":"2012-09-17T21:14:58+0000","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/175070432617690"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/175070432617690"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/175070432617690"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianamericanchicagonetwork/"}],"caption":"wepay.com","message":"TJCCC & TAP - Chicago - First-time Homebuyer/Owner Seminar is tomorrow, Tuesday 09/18/2012 6:30pm~8:30pm.
