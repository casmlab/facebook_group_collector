Sept 20. This Friday night. Join AACN at Untitled, Kinzie and Lasalle. 111 w kinzie, for drinks at 930pm. No cover. No gym shoes, tees.\n\ne were here a few weeks ago and it was fun, so we're coming back. This time, there will be a burlesque show as well! \n\nKnown as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name \"Untitled\") / trendy whiskey, champagne, and full bar lounge, this place is actually decent.\n\nLocation: This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.\n\nCTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away\n\nNOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.\n\nThe space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.\n\nNote Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line. Ladies, use judgment - usually they dont reject ladies but just no Sneakers, t-shirts, etc\n\nAll: The bouncer usually asks are you here for dinner or drinks. Just respond drinks.\n\nWhere we will Meet: WHISKEY ROOM TO THE LEFT.  We will meet here first (don't worry, you can drink anything you want - such as Champagne in the other room or a full bar in the main room - we are just meeting here first). Once you enter and go down the stairs, go directly to the left room which is the whiskey room of the restaurant/lounge, a hostess usually asks you if they can help you or are you here for dinner / drinks? Say drinks and just walk towards the side room on the left. \n\nFor late comers, we will probably eventually work our way to the back of the main dance floor (the bar in the back). \n\nDon't say you're here with AACN as we are not doing a reservation with the place.  They won't understand you.\n\nLook for Asians in the back and ask, \"Are you with AACN? ;)\" AACN will keep an eye out for you as well.\n\nBe on time at 9:30 PM!  it shouldn't be too crowded in the Whiskey room around that time."},{"id":"160475740743826_248828185241914","story":"Sandy Lee shared her event to the group: Asian American Chicago Network (AACN).","created_time":"2013-09-15T16:58:42+0000","from":{"name":"Sandy Lee","id":"10105495187701610"},"updated_time":"2013-09-15T16:58:42+0000","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/248828185241914"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/248828185241914"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/248828185241914"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianamericanchicagonetwork/"}],"caption":"KAC-Chicago's Financial Literacy Happy Hour 9/19","message":"KACC's Professional Development Series:\nFinancial Literacy Happy Hour \n \nThursday, September 19th at 7pm\n \nAs part of our professional development series, KACC is featuring guests who will present financial basics that every young professional needs to know to properly plan their future.

In less than 1 WEEK, it will be AACN's 2 year anniversary of our group (We were founded summer 2011).  Note that on THIS SATURDAY @ 1:30 PM (08/24/13) at \"The Kerryman\" in the fun River North neighborhood, we will celebrate over 1,000 members ! (Includes Facebook members, AACN Meetup Members, and our www.asianamericanchicagonetwork.com members).\n\nWe need your FULL participation from you. This will be an AWESOME time of fun networking/socializing with drink specials and food specials you can purchase. (Think of it as the Best Day Time Happy Hour in Chicago on a Saturday). WE WILL HAVE A REGISTRATION/SIGN IN SHEET AREA, so even if this is your first event with AACN, THAT IS OK - just come (even if it’s by yourself, and we will introduce you to many fun people). PLEASE RSVP ON THE MEETUP PAGE so we can at least estimate how many will be there.\n\nAdditionally, we will be celebrating our 2 year party by recognizing Shenny. Shenny has been an organizer of AACN and has built many strong relationships with our members. She will be moving to Madison, WI with her husband in August.
