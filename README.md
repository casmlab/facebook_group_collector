# FacebookGroupCollector
A script to collect facebook group information using Graph API

The effective scripts are fetch.html and json2.js. The rest are data grabbed from the Facebook Group: [Asian American Chicago Network (AACN)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianamericanchicagonetwork/). When reuse the code, change the groupId to your wanted group ID ( you might want to use a link-to-id tool like [this](https://lookup-id.com/)) and run the fecth.html in your browser. Click the instruction button, the data will be downloaded in JSON format.
