Working In Coalition & Increasing Voting Power\n\nWe work with a pan-Asian coalition where other organizations are covering different Asian immigrant communities all over Chicagoland. South Asian are the largest AAPI group in the northwest suburbs (nearly 40,000 out of 75k AAPIs collectively) and have extremely low participation/voting rates. \n\nFor example: Pakistani/Indian voters----  2672 Voted; 10,861 Did Not Vote\n\nB. Protecting Voting Rights\n\nWe our launching a South Asian voter engagement initiative where our goal is to increase voting, monitor/protect voting rights at the polls, and engage South Asian voters in issues that important to them. There has been numerous accounts of violations of voting rights in the northwest suburbs. We want to make sure we recruit election judges who are from our community and are trained in voting rights.\n\nC. Fighting Anti-Immigrant/Anti-Muslim/Anti-Sikh Narrative \n\nWe recognize the power of this voting block to influence an election and create pressure towards candidates to listen to often silenced/unheard voice. We are a 501c3 organization so we DO NOT support any candidates, but we are committed to working with community members (immigrants who can and can't vote) to build power to move elected officials. Governor Rauner has completely cut immigrant services, autism services, and other essential services. Many South Asian and other immigrants are disconnected from an advocacy and organizing efforts living outside of Chicago. We want to utilize this opportunity to help them lift their voices through an election and other civic engagement opportunities. This is particularly important in a time where anti-immigrant/anti-Muslim/anti-Sikh sentiment is running rampant which requires the courage and support of all communities especially those directly affected. Last year, in Darien, Illinois a Sikh man was a victim of a hate crime.", "story": "Fiona Smith shared Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Chicago's event to the group: Asian American Chicago Network (AACN).", "caption": "Asian Americans Get Out The Vote!", "type": "event", "message": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm the Civic Engagement Leader for Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

Doors open at 6PM!\n\nAS SEEN FROM KCON AND KPOP STAR: Special Performance by Korean Hip-Hop Duo @[226199047470018:274:Nomtom] & @[1635148426759701:274:Metoo]!\n\n*****FREE Lightsticks for the first 100 attendees!*****\n\nGet your discounted pre-sale tickets only at events.hallyuent.com only until New Year!\n*Edit: PHASETWO Presale tickets available only until Jan5. \n\nVIP Package Special:\n-Priority Entry\n-Fan Sign with NomTom & MeToo\n-Selfie Photo\n-Event flyer poster (you can have this signed!)\n-Complimentary Soju Bomb (21+ Only!)\n\nKPOP ALL NIGHT is the best of Asian Pop Culture all in one spectacular venue. Medusa is the perfect party destination - in addition to you playing your favorite Kpop videos on less than three giagantic HD Screens, Medusa also features a balcony and lounge (for those 21+ only). \n\nAs if our party wasn't already crazy enough, Korean Hip-Hop duo NomTom & MeToo will also fly out and grace KPOP ALL NIGHT with a LIVE performance! NomTom & MeToo have played at KCON in LA for the past two years and MeToo has been on KPOP STAR. Both of them played for Hallyu Entertainment's Asian Night Market Festival and KPOP ALL NIGHT in Dallas - fans loved them and we booked them again for your show in Chicago.\n\nWe'll be offering some crazy drink specials including $5 Soju Bombs for those who are 21+. Full Kpop themed drink menu coming soon.\n\nInvite all of your friends - this will be one spectacular, Kpop filled night.\n\n13 + $25 Presale, $35 at the door\n21 + $15 Presale, $25 at the door\nVIP (All Ages) $35 Presale, $45 at the door.\n\n*Teen Policy: This event is a \"Teen Club\" meaning you need to be at least thirteen years of age to attend. No exceptions. \n\n*Note for Parents regarding Alcohol: Alcohol will be served at our events, however please be assured that security measures are in place so that alcohol cannot end up in the hands of teens. Those drinking alcohol will be restricted to a separate section of the club and cannot take their drinks to the general area.\n\nDrinking Policy: If you are underage, do not even think about touching a drink. We have a strict no-tolernace policy. If one of our staff or security sees you with a drink in hand and you are underage, you will be escorted out by Elgin Police Department and you will be banned from all future Hallyu Entertainment events and concerts. No exceptions, no \"I was just holding this for a friend.\" At this particular event, we will have security checkpoints and attendees must have wristbands to be in all alcohol-designated areas.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Do I have to print my ticket or..?\nA: We are environmentally concious and designed our system so that you do not have to. Just show us your ticket confirmation or PayPal transaction from the email and we'll mark you off. In case your phone is out of batteries, just give use the name of the person who paid for the tickets and a valid government issued ID. Our system keeps track of this so you can't buy one ticket and have five people use that name...\n\nQ: Does the VIP Package include entry?\nA: Yes, of course.\n\nQ: Why are 13+ tickets more expensive than 21+ tickets?\nA: Always at an event that serves alcohol and caters to minors, there are inherent risks and liabilities on the promoter/venue end and the extra cost goes to cover increased security.\n\nQ: What should I wear?\nA: Dress to impress. If you need outfit suggestions, check out MV's like GD&TOP's High High or 2PM's Go Crazy. Please do not wear sweats, althetic shorts, etc.\n\nQ: Can you play my song?\nA: Sure! Just post a request in the group or ask the DJ. Please note that if you submit a ballad or something else that is slow, we may not play it.\n\nQ: Can I reserve a booth and buy bottles?\nA: Yes, just contact us and we will arrange a sweet deal for you.\n\nQ: What hotel are the performers staying at?\nA: Of course we can't tell you that... Unless you bought like 100 tickets, then we can talk.\n\nQ: Can we stay at the club for the event after?\nA: Yes, your ticket is good for the rest of the night's activities at Medusa.", "message_tags": [{"length": 49, "offset": 147, "name": "KPOP ALL NIGHT [JANUARY] [Chicago] feat.

Come support the film with your friends so we can get more Chinese-language films in Chicago! This film will be in Cantonese with Chinese and English subtitles. \n\nThe China Lion Entertainment (http://www.chinalionentertainment.com) releases Chinese-language films across the U.S. and Canada and would love to make Chicago a more regular stop for their films; of course, the only way for that to happen is through the support of local audiences. Let's help make this happen! \n\nAACN is given 4 free admission tickets. These can be used between Monday and Thursday. Please message me if you're interested in the ticket. Limited to 1 per person.\n\nThe film currently has an average rating of 6.7 (out of 10) on 豆瓣电影 (http://movie.douban.com/subject/20515977/), a Chinese movie review site.

This time, there will be a burlesque show as well! \n\nKnown as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name \"Untitled\") / trendy whiskey, champagne, and full bar lounge, this place is actually decent.\n\nLocation: This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.\n\nCTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away\n\nNOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.\n\nThe space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.\n\nNote Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line. Ladies, use judgment - usually they dont reject ladies but just no Sneakers, t-shirts, etc\n\nAll: The bouncer usually asks are you here for dinner or drinks. Just respond drinks.\n\nWhere we will Meet: WHISKEY ROOM TO THE LEFT.  We will meet here first (don't worry, you can drink anything you want - such as Champagne in the other room or a full bar in the main room - we are just meeting here first). Once you enter and go down the stairs, go directly to the left room which is the whiskey room of the restaurant/lounge, a hostess usually asks you if they can help you or are you here for dinner / drinks? Say drinks and just walk towards the side room on the left. \n\nFor late comers, we will probably eventually work our way to the back of the main dance floor (the bar in the back). \n\nDon't say you're here with AACN as we are not doing a reservation with the place.  They won't understand you.\n\nLook for Asians in the back and ask, \"Are you with AACN? ;)\" AACN will keep an eye out for you as well.\n\nBe on time at 9:30 PM!  it shouldn't be too crowded in the Whiskey room around that time.", "id": "160475740743826_249336205191112"}, {"created_time": "2013-09-15T16:58:42+0000", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/events/545276542205673/", "updated_time": "2013-09-15T16:58:42+0000", "name": "KAC-Chicago's Financial Literacy Happy Hour 9/19", "from": {"name": "Sandy Lee", "id": "10105495187701610"}, "description": "As part of our professional development series, KACC is featuring guests who will present financial basics that every young professional needs to know to properly plan their future.

Well, at 9 P.M., you're joining AACN for drinks and maybe an after party at UNTITLED (111 W. Kinzie Street)! Details below. \n\nKnown as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name \"Untitled\") / trendy whiskey, champagne, and full bar lounge, this place is actually decent.\n\nLocation: This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.\n\nCTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away\n\nNOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.\n\nThe space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.\n\nNote Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line. Ladies, use judgment - usually they dont reject ladies but just no Sneakers, t-shirts, etc\n\nAll: The bouncer usually asks are you here for dinner or drinks. Just respond drinks.\n\nWhere we will Meet: WHISKEY ROOM TO THE LEFT.  We will meet here first (don't worry, you can drink anything you want - such as Champagne in the other room or a full bar in the main room - we are just meeting here first). Once you enter and go down the stairs, go directly to the left room which is the whiskey room of the restaurant/lounge, a hostess usually asks you if they can help you or are you here for dinner / drinks? Say drinks and just walk towards the side room on the left. \n\nFor late comers, we will probably eventually work our way to the back of the main dance floor (the bar in the back). \n\nDon't say you're here with AACN as we are not doing a reservation with the place.  They won't understand you.\n\nLook for Asians in the back and ask - Are you with AACN? ;) AACN will keep an eye out for you as well.\n\nBe on time at 9 PM!  it shouldn't be too crowded in the Whiskey room at 9 PM.  \n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/AsianAmericanChicagoNetwork/events/136854372/", "likes": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxMDQ5MDU1MTcwMzEzNjYZD", "before": "MTAxMDQ5MDU1MTcwMzEzNjYZD"}}, "data": [{"name": "Daniel T Kim", "id": "10104905517031366"}]}, "message": "What are you up to on Friday?

AACN can hang out afterward.\n\n___________________________________________\n \nSynopsis:\nTHE GRANDMASTER is the highly-anticipated new film by acclaimed director Wong Kar Wai. Six years in the planning and three years in the making, THE GRANDMASTER is an epic action feature inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man. The story spans the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of China’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts. Filmed in a range of stunning locations that include the snow-swept landscapes of Northeast China and the subtropical South, THE GRANDMASTER features virtuoso performances by some of the greatest stars of contemporary cinema.\n\n With THE GRANDMASTER, Wong Kar Wai has made a kung fu film like no other. Years of research before production and a virtual battalion of martial arts trainers on set ensured that THE GRANDMASTER portrays both the Chinese martial arts and the world of the martial artists with unprecedented authenticity, with fight scenes choreographed by renowned action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (THE MATRIX, KILL BILL, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON.) The trio of international superstars at the film’s heart – Tony Leung, Ziyi Zhang and Chang Chen – all underwent several years of rigorous and extremely challenging kung fu training for their roles.\n\nShot by French Director of Photography Philippe Le Sourd and with art direction by Wong’s long-term collaborators William Chang Suk Ping and Alfred Yau Wai Ming, THE GRANDMASTER represents a new chapter in the martial arts genre and in Wong Kar Wai’s own stellar career.", "id": "160475740743826_243542282437171"}, {"created_time": "2013-08-08T00:15:11+0000", "link": "http://www.meetup.com/AsianAmericanChicagoNetwork/events/133268172/", "caption": "meetup.com", "type": "link", "updated_time": "2013-08-09T20:45:11+0000", "id": "160475740743826_242881892503210", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANalF6TVRJMU9EY3lORGM0T0RFeU9qRXpOell3T0RFeE1URT0ZD", "before": "WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZAFhKemIzSTZANalF6TVRFeE9UTXlORGd3TWpBMk9qRXpOell3TnpJd01EZAz0ZD"}}, "data": [{"created_time": "2013-08-09T18:13:28+0000", "object": {"message": "http://www.meetup.com/AsianAmericanChicagoNetwork/events/133268172/\n\nAACN FRIDAY EVENT!

We can meet up 7 am somewhere by grand park and we can join them like 7:30 am.
