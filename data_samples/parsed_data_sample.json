There are a couple separated areas of the restaurant and they have a good wine selection and full bar also. You guys can work out a drink list and pricing or work off the normal list. Attendees can also purchase appetizers if they are hungry. Here is a sunset painting I participated for another wine and canvas event...it turned out a little different and more bold than the artist's. Another idea is maybe cherry blossoms over a Japanese rock garden and bridge. I've seen people do starry night also. Be sure to publicize date and time. I'd love to attend!
