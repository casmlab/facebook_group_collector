Launched in June 2011 by Mandarin Communications Group, Mandarin Quarterly has become the must-read for Chinese-speakers interested in dining, shopping, and real estate, but also entrepreneurship, architecture, philanthropy, and the arts.","from":{"name":"Sandy Chang","id":"10105495187387240"},"id":"160475740743826_273440556114010","link":"https://www.facebook.com/events/679929472029138/","message":"Come join TJCCC and Mandarin Quarterly Chicago for the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony Viewing Party at Vora - a night of fun as we support various countries participating in the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia as well as a special opportunity to meet an Olympian.","name":"TJCCC & Mandarin Quarterly Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony Viewing Party","story":"Sandy Chang shared her event to the group: Asian American Chicago Network (AACN).","type":"event","updated_time":"2014-02-06T19:53:01+0000","comments":{"data":[{"from":{"name":"Sandy Chang","id":"10105495187387240"},"message":"Open bar for beer and wine!!","created_time":"2014-02-06T19:53:01+0000","id":"273947602729972"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNamN6T1RRM05qQXlOekk1T1RjeU9qRXpPVEUzTVRZek9ERT0=","before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNamN6T1RRM05qQXlOekk1T1RjeU9qRXpPVEUzTVRZek9ERT0="}}}},{"created_time":"2014-02-04T06:24:55+0000","from":{"name":"Noelle Lynn","id":"10100102502253405"},"id":"160475740743826_273512562773476","message":"EXTRAS NEEDED: On Sunday February 9th we are shooting the TEASER trailer for my new feature film “Not Another Zombie Movie….About the Living Dead” If you’re interested in being a zombie for the trailer, please send us an email at CanIBeAZombie@gmail.com.","type":"status","updated_time":"2014-02-04T06:24:55+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10204979214741201","name":"ChristAnh C-Reyus N"},{"id":"10107300708747964","name":"Samuel Meadows"},{"id":"10206554418672751","name":"Jason Michael Braden"},{"id":"10205937961701927","name":"Jonathan Kang"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDU5Mzc5NjE3MDE5Mjc=","before":"MTAyMDQ5NzkyMTQ3NDEyMDE="}}}},{"caption":"meetup.com","created_time":"2014-02-03T19:02:52+0000","description":"Group description: See our webpage - www.asianamericanchicagonetwork.com Welcome!
