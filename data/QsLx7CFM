(There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.\n\nCTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away\n\nNOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.\n\nThe space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.\n\nNote Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night. Wear dress shoes, no baggy jeans, no sneakers, and no polos accepted. You should be fine with jeans and a button down shirt. Get there on time for no lines - this place is free to enter... but if you come later.. you will be waiting in line. Ladies, use judgment - usually they dont reject ladies but just no Sneakers, t-shirts, etc\n\nAll: The bouncer usually asks are you here for dinner or drinks. Just respond drinks.\n\nWhere we will Meet: WHISKEY ROOM TO THE LEFT.  We will meet here first (don't worry, you can drink anything you want - such as Champagne in the other room or a full bar in the main room - we are just meeting here first). Once you enter and go down the stairs, go directly to the left room which is the whiskey room of the restaurant/lounge, a hostess usually asks you if they can help you or are you here for dinner / drinks? Say drinks and just walk towards the side room on the left. \n\nFor late comers, we will probably eventually work our way to the back of the main dance floor (the bar in the back). \n\nDon't say you're here with AACN as we are not doing a reservation with the place.  They won't understand you.\n\nLook for Asians in the back and ask, \"Are you with AACN? ;)\" AACN will keep an eye out for you as well.\n\nBe on time at 9:30 PM!  it shouldn't be too crowded in the Whiskey room around that time.","type":"status","updated_time":"2013-09-19T03:37:15+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"10105523450622608","name":"Jessica Lee"},{"id":"10207909193868164","name":"Tina Chu"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAyMDc5MDkxOTM4NjgxNjQ=","before":"MTAxMDU1MjM0NTA2MjI2MDg="}}}},{"caption":"KAC-Chicago's Financial Literacy Happy Hour 9/19","created_time":"2013-09-15T16:58:42+0000","description":"As part of our professional development series, KACC is featuring guests who will present financial basics that every young professional needs to know to properly plan their future.

Well, at 9 P.M., you're joining AACN for drinks and maybe an after party at UNTITLED (111 W. Kinzie Street)! Details below. \n\nKnown as one of Chicago's newest hidden (hence the name \"Untitled\") / trendy whiskey, champagne, and full bar lounge, this place is actually decent.\n\nLocation: This place is located right next to the CVS on Kinzie and LaSalle and before the parking Garage. It's literally the door next to the CVS and there are no signs either except for probably a bouncer / and a roped off area. (There is easy parking at garages next door $12 to $15 the whole night.\n\nCTA - Merchandise Mart stop is only 2 blocks away\n\nNOTE: Parking on the streets around Hubbard is only until 11 PM. (Cars are towed from 11 PM to 5 AM on those streets) - Watch out for signs. TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION / CABS IF POSSIBLE.\n\nThe space—part restaurant, part lounge and part whiskey bars—boasts 17,000 square feet in an unmarked building with soaring ceilings, a street-level facade with a monthly rotating mysterious storefront, 120-seat restaurant and a whiskey lounge, aka The Library, with 18-foot ceilings, tufted leather walls, velvet booths, gilded framed mirrors that shield nearly 10 LCD TVs and a wall of wooden liquor lockers holding one of the country's largest collections of whiskey.\n\nNote Dress CODE Enforced: Men, this place has a STRICT dress code at night.
