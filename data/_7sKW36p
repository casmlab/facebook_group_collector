Their participants are Chicago residents with limited income and who have at least one child in grades K-3. We select families after a thorough interview process that confirms a strong foundation at home and a commitment to making the most of education.\nhttp://horizons-for-youth.org/\n\nMore about Journey World:\nJourney World is an experiential programming space designed to inspire the next generation of civic and community leaders. The sensory-stimulating center is uniquely designed as two separate floors that spotlight interrelated learning opportunities. On the It's Your Future- Dream It! floor, a \"mini-city\" invites students to simulate real job responsibilities in offices that have been visually customized to resemble known institutions and businesses. The programs culminate with a full-day simulation at Journey World where students apply important concepts and skills as they take on real-life business, government, and science careers. \nhttp://www.girlscoutsgcnwi.org/journey-world\n\nMore about TAP-Chicago:\nhttp://tapchicago.org \n\nQuestions?
