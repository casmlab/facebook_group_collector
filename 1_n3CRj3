Next month we’re raising a Kickstarter for the first product, also named Jackie. \n\nPlease like our Facebook page! www.facebook.com/eightsix91\n\nThe product is a drone, a flying smartcamera platform that syncs straight to your phone. You can use Jackie to check on anything in your home - whether you locked the door when you left, if the repair person has come, checking on your pet etc.\n\nAnd if you’d like, sign up for our email list: www.bit.ly/seewhatjackiesees","link":"https://www.facebook.com/eightyninerobotics","name":"Eighty Nine Robotics","picture":"https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hprofile-xfp1/v/t1.0-1/c78.0.200.200/p200x200/11742667_873745892698912_3200904440265179459_n.jpg?oh=e95ee5d8feaa0a20545cf602d0ac3ac6&oe=566948E6","object_id":"807582969315205","comments":{"data":[{"comment_count":0,"message":"Purrtty dope!","id":"359166934208038","created_time":"2015-03-12T06:14:21+0000","from":{"name":"Elvis Thao","id":"10153690681903338"}}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNelU1TVRZMk9UTTBNakE0TURNNE9qRTBNall4TkRBNE5qRT0=","before":"WTI5dGJXVnVkRjlqZFhKemIzSTZNelU1TVRZMk9UTTBNakE0TURNNE9qRTBNall4TkRBNE5qRT0="}}}},{"id":"160475740743826_358982570893141","created_time":"2015-03-11T03:29:21+0000","from":{"name":"Leo Nguyen","id":"10153639534144402"},"updated_time":"2015-03-11T15:12:04+0000","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/358982570893141"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/358982570893141"},{"name":"Share","link":"https://www.facebook.com/160475740743826/posts/358982570893141"},{"name":"Create Group Chat","link":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/asianamericanchicagonetwork/"}],"caption":"chicago.craigslist.org","message":"Anyone looking for an apartment in Irving Park?
