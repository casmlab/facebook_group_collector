The room faces Chicago skyline. The building is just a walking distance, one block, from the CTA, Clark and Division red line station. Moreover, Jewel Osco is right on the corner of CTA. Now, I and my friend occupy the bedrooms. We are currently paying $2,300 per month, not including utilities. You will be paying only $600 per month. Utilities fees will be divided amongst three of us. There are gym, business center, which provide Wi-Fi and free printing, laundry room, and outdoor swimming pool in the building. The living room is very nice and clean. We would like to keep our apartment clean all the time. The living room is unfurnished and spacious. We also attached the floorplan and the pictures from http://www.ppmapartments.com/properties/gold-coast/1120-n-lasalle/. The lease will end July 30th, 2015.
